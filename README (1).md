# LangChain + Hugging Face: First Steps

Welcome to my first attempt at using LangChain with Hugging Face! This project is an introduction to combining language model capabilities using LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models, with Hugging Face's extensive model repository.

## Project Overview

In this project, I explore the basics of LangChain and Hugging Face to build a simple language model application. The main objectives are:
- Understanding the core components of LangChain
- Integrating models from Hugging Face
- Experimenting with language generation, retrieval, and response handling

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Hugging Face account and API key (for certain models)
- Familiarity with Python and natural language processing basics

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up Hugging Face API access (if using restricted models):

    ```bash
    export HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="your_hugging_face_api_key"
    ```

### Requirements

- **LangChain**: Provides the building blocks for LLM applications.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: To access pre-trained language models for generation and other tasks.

## Usage

Run the main script to start experimenting with LangChain + Hugging Face models:

```bash
python main.py
